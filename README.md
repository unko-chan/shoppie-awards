## The Challenge

We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
* Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
* Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
* View the list of films already nominated
* Remove a nominee from the nomination list

Technical requirements:
* Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
* Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
* Updates to the search terms should update the result list
* Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
* If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
* Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
